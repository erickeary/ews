<h2>Dynamic Typing</h2>
<h3>Variable creation</h3>
<p>A variable, think of it as a name, is created when it is first assigned.</p>
<p>Future assignments only change the value associated with the name.</p>
<h3>Variable types</h3>
<p>There is no such thing. Types live with the objects the variable references, and not the variable itself.</p>
<h3>Variable use</h3>
<p>When a variable is used in an expression, it is immediately replaced with the object it currently refers to.</p>
<p>Variables are entries in a system table with space for links to objects.</p>
<p>Objects are pieces of allocated memory holding the values they represent.</p>
<p>References are pointers from variables to objects.</p>
<p>Objects are garbage-collected when the object reference counters are decremented to 0.</p>
