<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>Names that begin with an underscore (_name) are not imported with a from module import *</p>
<p>Names that are prefixed and suffixed with double underscores (__name__) are system-defined names that have meaning to the interpreter.</p>
<p>Names that are only prefixed with two underscores (__name) are localized "mangled" to enclosing classes.</p>
<p>A single underscore is a variable name that stores the result of the last expression when in interactive mode.</p>
